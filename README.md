# NationalParksProject
#A pilot of the UI-UE in the browser for a National Park blog website using Yellowstone as the 1st Park. This was my Capstone project for my Web Development Fundamentals course through The Last Mile. 
#The project is not connected to a server so there is no functionality to any interactivity that involves submitting infromation.
#The home page shows how a user would log in and indicate various preferences for the proposed blog.
#There is also an about the Park page which tells the gives the user a brief summary of several distinct aspects of Yellowstone National Park and allows the user to expand each section to read more as desired. 
#The 3rd page is a timed quiz that randomly picks 10 questions from a bank of 20 questions and presents them in a random order so that each quiz is different. All the infromation needed to answer the questions is presented in the About page.
